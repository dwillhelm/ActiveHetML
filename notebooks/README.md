Here, I will demonstrate how active learning can be used to design a vdW bilayer with an optimal band edge of your choosing. First I will perform an initial analysis of the dataset and test some machine learning models to predict the IE ([Notebook 1](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/01-data_exploration.ipynb)). Afterward, I will use active learning to build new machine learning models starting with only 10 initial samples ([Notebook 2](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/02-active_learning_for_DFT_surrogate.ipynb)). Then, I will demonstrate how to use active learning to optimize the IE for a given target value ([Notebook 3](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/03-active_learning_property_optimization.ipynb)).
