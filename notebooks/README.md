# Notebooks 

Here, I will demonstrate how active learning can be used to design a vdW bilayer with an optimal band edge of your choosing. First I will perform an initial analysis of the dataset in [Notebook 1](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/01-data_exploration.ipynb). Afterward, I will test some machine learning models to predict the IE in [Notebook 2](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/02-machine_learning.ipynb). Then I will use active learning to build new machine learning models starting with only 10 initial samples in [Notebook 3](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/03-active_learning_for_DFT_surrogate.ipynb). Then, I will demonstrate how to use active learning to optimize the IE for a given target value in [Notebook 4](https://github.com/dwillhelm/ActiveHetML/blob/main/notebooks/04-active_learning_property_optimization.ipynb).
